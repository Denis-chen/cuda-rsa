MPZ
===

MPZ stands for Multiple Precision Integer (Z = integers in math).

The MPZ code is structured so that it can be compiled by nvcc for
use in CUDA kernels, or by g++ for use on the cpu.

To use the MPZ code, just include "mpz.h" in your source file.

The available mpz functions are documented in mpz.h.
