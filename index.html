  <td>Apr 1-7</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Decide on a project.
  <td>&nbsp;Chose to work on a CUDA based integer factorizor, with a possible goal
  of breaking RSA encryptions</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Apr 8-14</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Create proposal, choose algorithm, choose/implement multiple precision
    library</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Wrote proposal, investigated Pollard's p - 1 algorithm as well as the
    elliptic curve method for factorization.  Decided, based on promising results as
    well as our ability to understand it, to start with Pollard's algorithm. </td>

  <td>Apr 15-21</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Finalize multiple precision implementation,
    begin GPU based implementation</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Began CPU implementation of Pollard's algorithm using longs. Began working
    on Multiple Precision library.</td>

  <td>Apr 22-28</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Continue work on GPU implementation <br> &nbsp;
    Finish GPU based implementation of Pollard's algorithm, using longs</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Finished CPU implementation of Pollard's algorithm, and began GPU
    implementation (again using longs), near completion of GPU implementation.
    Completed most of Multiple Precision library.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Apr 29-May 5</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Finish work on MP library and adapt GPU factor code to use MP library.
  <br>&nbsp;Profile code, create test suite and begin comparing to standards
  </td>&nbsp;Major refactor of MP library, addition of factorization specific
  operations.<br
  &nbsp;Port of GPU code to our MP library lots of debugging... trying
  to figure out why it runs so slow.
  <td/></td>

<tr>
  <td>May 6-11</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Consider optimizations, reworks for specific GPU architecture<br>
    &nbsp;Implement RSA cracking, using factorization algorithm, evaluate viability
    of stretch goals</td>
  <td>&nbsp;Restructuring of GPU algorithm, lots of tweaking, and testing.
