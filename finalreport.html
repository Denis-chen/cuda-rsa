<div class="section">Background</div>

<p>We implemented Pollard's p-1 Algorithm to factor large integers using CUDA 
to run on the GPU. Our project codebase includes:
  <ul>
    <li>A multiple precision integer library for CUDA.<li>
    <li>The implementation of Pollard's p-1 which runs on top of the multiple
    precision library.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<div class="section">Background</div>

<p>There are many algorithms designed to factor large prime numbers quickly.
Pollard's p-1 Algorithm takes advantage of Fermat's Little Theorem to find
factors of a compound number n. The algorithm is not inherently parallel and
is limited in the number of factors it can find as the size of n increases.
A better, and inherently parallel algorithm, is Lenstra's Elliptic Curve
algorithm. It's inherent parallelism makes it an attractive algorithm but it is
quite complicated.</p>

<p>One application of finding prime factors is in RSA
RSA is a popular asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. An asymmetric cryptographic
algorithm is one that uses two different keys, one public and one private, to encrypt
and decrypt messages. Thus in order to break RSA, we must determine the private key
from the public key. In RSA, the public key is a tuple (n, e) where n is a large
number with two large prime factors, p and q. The private key is d. If we can compute
p and q from n, then we can determine d. Thus beging able to find the prime factors
of large numbers is the key to breaking RSA. More information on the algorithm can
be found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)">Wikipedia</a>
page for RSA.</p>

<p>Currently we are able to factor integers on the GPU and are working on 
parallelizing the algorithm.</p>
