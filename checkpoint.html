<p>
  This page explains the progress and updates made to date on the CUDA RSA project.
  Beside that which is on this page, updates have also been made to the main page
  schedule, giving a brief overview of progress with respect to the goals set forth
  by the project proposal and the new goals given the work done so far (as explained
  below).  Small edits and clarifications have also been made to the project proposal.

<div class="section">Progress to Date</div>
<p>
  The emphasis of our project is on creating a CUDA based factorizer, so most of our
  effort so far has been put to researching, understanding, and evaluating factorization
  algorithms.  However, in order to create a meaningful large number factorizer, we also
  require an API for large (greater than 64 bit) integers.  Consequently our initial
  focus has been split between understanding and implementing basic factorization
  algorithms and creating a solid GPU multiple precision integer library on which we will
  rely.
  <br>
  Because of the reported success of Pollard's p - 1 algorithm given by
  &quot;<a href="reference/lin.pdf">Efficient Paralles RSA Decryption Algorithm
    for Many-Core GPUs with CUDA</a>,&quot; we decided to first implement this algorithm
  completely before dabbling in any others.  This way, we can increase the chance that
  we will be able to end up with a complete project.  We first implemented a single
  threaded version of the algorithm to ensure that we understand it and are able to
  replicate it.  Since we do not yet have multiple precision resources on the GPU we
  decided to use longs in our CPU version, so that the code would be nearly directly
  transferrable to the GPU.  After finishing and testing the CPU version, we began work
  on the GPU version.  At the moment, the GPU version is nearly complete, but uses a
  poor method for determining which value of k to use, which makes sense in a single
  threaded application but does not work as well on the GPU.  The next step to be taken
  is to use a large global prime table as recommended in the above paper.  Once that is
  complete, we must still connect the algorithm to our multiple precision library.
