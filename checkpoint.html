<div class="section">Checkpoint Overview</div>
<p>
  This page explains the progress and updates made to date on the CUDA RSA project.
  Beside that which is on this page, updates have also been made to the main page
  schedule, giving a brief overview of progress with respect to the goals set forth
  by the project proposal and the new goals given the work done so far (as explained
  below).  Small edits and clarifications have also been made to the project proposal.
</p>

<div class="section">Progress to Date</div>

  <p>The emphasis of our project is on creating a CUDA based factorizer, so most of our
  effort so far has been put to researching, understanding, and evaluating factorization
  algorithms.  However, in order to create a meaningful large number factorizer, we also
  require an API for large (greater than 64 bit) integers.  Consequently our initial
  focus has been split between understanding and implementing basic factorization
  algorithms and creating a solid GPU multiple precision integer library on which we will
  rely.</p>

  <h3>Implementing Factoriztion</h3>

  <p>Because of the reported success of Pollard's p - 1 algorithm given by
  &quot;<a href="reference/lin.pdf">Efficient Paralles RSA Decryption Algorithm
    for Many-Core GPUs with CUDA</a>,&quot; we decided to first implement this algorithm
  completely before dabbling in any others.  This way, we can increase the chance that
  we will be able to end up with a complete project.  We first implemented a single
  threaded version of the algorithm to ensure that we understand it and are able to
  replicate it.  Since we do not yet have multiple precision resources on the GPU we
  decided to use longs in our CPU version, so that the code would be nearly directly
  transferrable to the GPU.  After finishing and testing the CPU version, we began work
  on the GPU version.  At the moment, the GPU version is nearly complete, but uses a
  poor method for determining which value of k to use, which makes sense in a single
  threaded application but does not work as well on the GPU.  The next step to be taken
  is to use a large global prime table as recommended in the above paper.  Once that is
  complete, we must still connect the algorithm to our multiple precision library.</p>

  <h3>Multiple Precision Library</h3>

  <p>Work on the Multiple Precision Integer library for CUDA has been progressing well.
  We have a partially completed and well tested library with the following functionality:
  <ul>
    <li>Initialization of arbitrary length integers (positive and negative)</li>
    <li>Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication</li>
    <li>Comparison</li>
  </ul>
  We have created the library such that it can be compiled by both <code>g++</code> and
  <code>nvcc</code> for testing on the CPU and GPU respectively. In addition we have a
  robust unit test suite to ensure correctness.</p>
  
  <p>The remaining work in the multiple precision library is to implement division, power, 
  and modulus.</p>

<div class="section">Updated Goals and Deliverables</div>

<p>We have been keeping good pace with our original schedule and we think we can hit
most of the goals we originally set. Here is what we think we'll have at the end of
the project:
<ul>
  <li>A working multiple precision library for CUDA</li>
  <li>A CUDA implementation of Pollard's p-1 algorithm built on top of the MP library</li>
  <li>Analysis (graphical and written) of the performance of our implementation against
    various CPU based implementations.</li>
</ul>
And as a stretch goal we hope to have:
<ul>
  <li>Code that interfaces with RSA so we can demo the power of being able to factor
    large numbers quickly.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Our demo will depend on whether or not we can implement the RSA portion of the project.
Obviously, it is the most flashy and would give a good demo. We would start the demo off
by encrypting a message with a small key (like a 64-bit key). Then we would give a short
presentation about our project and findings. Then at the end of the presentation our code
will have factored the public key, decrypted the message, and output the message to the
screen, thus demonstrating the power of our implementation. It may be the case that
writing code to interface with RSA is too difficult or tedious, in which case this
presentation won't be possible. In this case, we can still demonstrate our program's 
factoring on large numbers. We could use a number likely to be used in RSA (large number
with two, large, prime factors).</p>

<div class="section">Preliminary Results</div>

<p>Our only preliminary results are that we can factor small numbers on the CPU using
Pollard's p-1 algorithm, and that our MP library is passing all tests for what is currently
implemented.</p>

<div class="section">Issues / Concerns</div>

<p>We are making good progress and do not have any major concerns at this time. Finishing
the rest of the project should hopefully just be a matter of coding and puzzling out how
to best parallelize Pollard's p-1 Algorithm. Our biggest challenges are yet to come but 
we think we will be able to have a working project in time. The only concern at this time
is getting RSA working, but that is a stretch goal.</p>
