Background
  - description pollard's p-1 algorithm (David)

Approach
  - mpz (David)
    -> talk about using base 10 =(
    -> talk about things we wanted to implement (karatsuba)
    -> talk about good algorithms used (exponentiation by squaring)
  - CUDAing pollard (AJ)
  - Tweaking to get better performance (AJ)

Results

*** Talk about changing 10 to 2^32

  - How are we gaging performance (AJ)
  - describe GPU v CPU graph (David)
  - describe GPU v GMP graph (AJ)
  - describe results relative to lin.pdf (David)
  - Are the results of the lin paper valid? (AJ)
