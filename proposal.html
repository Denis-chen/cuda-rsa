<div class="section">Summary</div>
Efficiently factor large numbers using CUDA.

<div class="section">Background</div>

<p>There are many algorithms designed to factor large prime numbers quickly.
Pollard's p-1 Algorithm takes advantage of Fermat's Little Theorem to find 
factors of a compound number n. The algorithm is not inherently parallel and 
is limited in the number of factors it can find as the size of n increases.
A better, and inherently parallel algorithm, is Lenstra's Elliptic Curve
algorithm. It's inherent parallelism makes it an attractive algorithm but it is
quite complicated.</p>

<p>One application of finding prime factors is in RSA
RSA is a popular asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. An asymmetric cryptographic
algorithm is one that uses two different keys, one public and one private, to encrypt
and decrypt messages. Thus in order to break RSA, we must determine the private key
from the public key. In RSA, the public key is a tuple (n, e) where n is a large
number with two large prime factors, p and q. The private key is d. If we can compute
p and q from n, then we can determine d. Thus beging able to find the prime factors
of large numbers is the key to breaking RSA. More information on the algorithm can 
be found on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(algorithm)">Wikipedia</a>
page for RSA.</p>


<div class="section">Challenge</div>
<p>The challenges in implementing a prime number factorization algorithm is twofold.
First, we will be doing math operations on numbers much larger than can be held
in typical x86 primitives. Normally there are many libraries that exist to run 
multiple precision arithmetic, but there aren't any complete libraries available 
for CUDA. There exists a partially implemented port of the GNU Multiple Precision
library called <a href="http://www.hpcs.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~nakayama/cump/">CUMP</a>. 
We may have to extend this library or write the instructions we need from scratch.</p>

<p>The other challenge is in choosing an algorithm to do factorization and 
implementing it. All of the algorithms are inherently complex. In addition, if we
choose to implement Pollard's p-1 Algorithm, we will have to figure out how to
efficiently parallelize it.</p>

<div class="section">Resources</div>

<div class="section">Goals/Deliverables</div>
The goals are as follows:
<ol>
  <li>Implement the basic multiple precision functions needed (e.g. multiplication,
  subtraction, division, addition, modulus)</li>
  <li>Implement the chosen factoring algorithm.</li>
</ol>

Some stretch goals:
<ol>
  <li>Interface our factorization code with RSA.</li>
  <li>Extend CUMP or write a somewhat complete library for doing multiple precision
      arithmetic on CUDA.</li>
</ol>

<div class="comment">[Please do not modify the schedule on this page
after the proposal process (it is your proposed schedule, and it will
be useful to compare it to your actually project logs at the end of
the project).  Update the schedule on your project main page if your
goals or timeline changes over the course of the project.]</div>
